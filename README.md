# MNIST HANDWRITTEN DIGIT CLASSIFICATION
Handwritten digit recognition refers to the process of identifying and classifying handwritten numbers, typically ranging from 0 to 9. We used technologies like convolutional neural networks (CNN). For this project, we are going to use Keras, a TensorFlow library that provides a Python interface for artificial neutal networks. The basic data structures in Keras are layers and models. After building our model, we will use scikit-learn library to evaluate its peroformance.
The data used for this project is the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset first released in 1999. It contains 60,000 28x28 grayscale training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The dataset became a classical learning tool for computer vision and classification algorithms.

# OUTPUT

As the system takes the input in the form of image-path and then gives the output as which DIGIT is the image representing.
Here, we took the input path of image THREE and then it gives the ouput of the image as : 3

# APPLICATION in real life 
1. FORM DIGITALIZATION
   Converts hand written numbers on forms to digital data, making data storage more efficient
2. SIGNATURE VERIFICATION
   Helps in verifying handwritten signatures to prevent fraud signatures.
